- **Terraform:** Allows you to provision, manage, and version infrastructure resources (e.g., servers, databases, networks) using a declarative(you describe what you want, and Terraform figures out how to achieve it) configuration language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)
- **Terraform Providers:** https://github.com/nawab312/Terraform/blob/main/Providers/Notes.md
- **Resources:** Resources are the building blocks of your infrastructure in Terraform. Example: An EC2 instance, an S3 bucket, or a database.
