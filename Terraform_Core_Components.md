**Providers**
- Provider is a plugin responsible for interacting with an API of a service or platform
- Provider allows Terraform to manage infrastructure resources such as cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), DNS providers, version control systems, and more
- Each provider defines resources and data sources that Terraform can use to create, update, and delete infrastructure. Like with AWS Provider we can create EC2 Instances
```hcl
#providers.tf

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 3.0"
    }
  }
}
```
- Terraform allows you to use multiple providers in the same configuration.
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

provider "google" {
  project = "my-project"
  region  = "us-central1"
}
```
- Terraform providers themselves canâ€™t typically be extended directly by users, but they can be customized in a couple of ways. One way is through the use of local-exec or remote-exec provisioners. The community sometimes creates custom providers, or you can even build your own provider using the Go programming language
- The `terraform providers lock` command is useful to lock down the versions of the providers you are using in your configuration, preventing unexpected issues from newer provider releases and ensuring your Terraform setup is reproducible and consistent
```bash
terraform init

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v5.88.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v5.88.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.
```
```bash
#.terraform.lock.hcl

 This file is maintained automatically by "terraform init".
# Manual edits may be lost in future updates.

provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws" {
  version = "5.88.0"

Success! Terraform has validated the lock file and found no need for changes.
```
- Using Assume Role for Cross-Account Access
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
  assume_role {
    role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-cross-account-role"
    session_name = "TerraformSession"
  }
}
```

---

**Variables**

```hcl
#variables.tf

variable "region" {
  description = "AWS Region"
  type = String
  value = "us-east-1"  
}
```

```hcl
#main.tf

provider "region" {
  region = var.region  
}
```

```hcl
#terraform.tfvars

region = "us-west-2"
```

- *variables.tf Define the variables and their properties.
- *terraform.tfvars* Specifies value for variables
- Use -var to override: `terraform apply -var="region=us-east-1"`

---

**Outputs**
- Outputs allow you to display specific information after applying a Terraform configuration, such as the instance ID, public IP address, etc. Outputs can also be used to pass data between modules.
- Outputs can be marked as sensitive to hide their values in logs `sensitive = true`

```hcl
output "instance_id" {
  description = "The ID Of the Instance"
  value = aws_instance.example.id
}
```

---

**Data Source**
- Data sources are used to query existing infrastructure in your cloud environment or external systems.
- Example: Retrieve the latest AMI for a specific operating system.
  - Why `aws_ami` Supports `filter {}`
    - The `aws_ami` data source retrieves Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), which have multiple properties that require filtering.
```hcl
data "aws_ami" "latest_amazon_linux" {
    most_recent = true
    owners = ["amazon"]
    filter {
        name = "name"
        values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
    }
}

output "ami_id" {
    value = data.aws_ami.latest_amazon_linux.id
}
```
- Retrieve an Existing AWS VPC
```hcl
data "aws_vpc" "default" {
  default = true
}
```
- Retrieve an Existing AWS IAM Policy
```hcl
data "aws_iam_policy" "admin" {
    name = "Administrator Access"
}
```
